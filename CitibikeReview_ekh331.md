# Overview

## In this file, I will:
1. Verify that null and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly;
2. Verify that the data supports the project
 "if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values"
 
3. Choose an appropriate test to test the null hypothesis
4. Provide additional comments, suggestions, and a suggested appropriate statistical test with justification.

# Hypothesis review
The idea to be investgated is the following:
"Older people are less likely than younger people to use citibikes overnight (19:00-5:00)"
This is an interesting question, and I think it will come down to what designates "older"  versus "younger" people.
The idea above is somewhat imprecise, leaving it open to multiple interpretations. One such interpretation is the null and alternative hypothesis provided in the assignment: <br>


The following null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are described. <br>
Null: "The ratio of older people (>=40) biking at night over all older people biking during a day is _the same_ or _higher_  than the ratio of younger people (< 40) biking at night to all the younger people biking during a day"
<p>
Alternative: The ratio of younger people biking at night over the total number of younger people riding a bike during a 24 hour period is greater than the ratio of older people riding a bike at night over the number of older people who ride bikes in the 24 hour period.
<p>

One way to write the null hypothesis that should be considered is that instead of having the proportions in a kind of inequality 
(young proportion is less than or equal to old proportion), the proportions should be set as equal to each other,
since we know nothing about the proportions. The default assumption should be that they are equal instead of an inequality.

The student chose an alpha of 0.05, meaning that under the null hypothesis, the probability of obtaining a result as least as significant would be 5%.
