# Overview

## In this file, I will:
1. Verify that null and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly;
2. Verify that the data supports the project
 "if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values"
 
3. Choose an appropriate test to test the null hypothesis
4. Provide additional comments, suggestions, and a suggested appropriate statistical test with justification.

# Hypothesis review
The idea to be investgated is the following:
"Older people are less likely than younger people to use citibikes overnight (19:00-5:00)"
This is an interesting question, and I think it will come down to what designates "older"  versus "younger" people.

The student writes the following null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis:<br>
"The ratio of older people (>=40) biking at night over all older people biking during a day is _the same_ or _higher_  than the ratio of younger people (< 40) biking at night to all the younger people biking during a day"

\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

The student chose an alpha of 0.05.
