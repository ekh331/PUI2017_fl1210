# HW1_3 

**Question**

Create a reproducible research chunk of code.

**Solution**

1. I learned about the definition of pseudorandom number generation in computers. 

2. Then I generated a seed so that the code is reproducible.

3. I generated 50 sets of random 2x100 data points in Gaussian distribution all with different mean and plotted Figure 1.

4. Then I give different mean along x and y axis for the 50 sets of data and plotted Figure 2.
