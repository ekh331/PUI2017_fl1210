# PUI2017 HW 3

I did the work follow Prof. Bianco's sample code. I also refer to google and NumPy Reference for help.The work is done individually.

## Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem. 

1. I defined the sizes of 100 samples (all integers between 10 and 2000).

2. I genenerated 100 samples for Chi-Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial and Exponential distributions respectively.

3. For each kind of distribution, I plot the sample mean against the sample size N (scatter plot) and the distribution of sample means (histogram). I also described what I found form those plots.

4. I FIT a gaussian to the distribution of means.

## Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.

1. I described the question I am interested in examining and the Null and Alternative hypothesis. I also set the significance threshold. 

2. I use pandas to read in the CitiBike files of one month. Add a column of ['date'] which is in datatime format.

3. Remove columns that I am not using.

4. Plot the distribution of Citibike bikers by age.


## Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook .

1. I described the Null and Alternative hypothesis in words and in formula.

2. I set the significance threshold that I chose. 

2. I downloaded the raw data.

3. I calculated the z value and compared with the significance threshold.

4. I concluded about the result and reject the Null Hypothesis.
